I've taken a short break after getting Parley to 1.2.1 - somewhere I
feel it's stable, and functional (for the most part).

I still consider it to be under active development and I'm more than
happy to receive patches - I'd love more people to be using and
developing it.

Aah yes; the bulk of Parley was written before Chained() was a sparkle  
in Catalyst's eye.

I've never needed to modify it but have no objections to it going that  
route.

I've often wondered how to make Parley part of a larger app/solution  
so any suggestions or patches in that direction will be greatly  
appreciated.

1.2.x was released primarily for the namespace change to the schema to  
help ensure that it doesn't pollute someone else's table-space if they  
were ever brave enough to try it themselves.

I'd also quite like to investigate OpenID authentication as a route  
towards making it easier for people to get an app account.

If you think that you might have suggestions and patches it would be  
great if you could sign-up to the Parley Discuss list. It's so low  
traffic that I forget it's there until someone emails me about Parley.

It's useful to have archived messages to refer back to.
