Subject: [Parley-discuss] Patch to upgrade the included Module::Install
Message-ID: <201105051341.31318.stefan.seifert@atikon.com>

Attached is a patch to simply upgrade the inc directory to a current 
Module::Install version, thereby enabling the auto_installing of dependencies.

Subject: [Parley-discuss] Patch: use search_path instead of hard coded
	schema name in half of the statements in parley.sql
Message-ID: <201105051345.10973.stefan.seifert@atikon.com>

Schema name was only used when creating tables, not when inserting data, so a 
simple psql parley -f db/parley.sql would not work.
    
Using search_path reduces usage of the schema name to only two lines making it 
easier to change (or remove).

Subject: [Parley-discuss] Patch: fix signup of new users
Message-ID: <201105061420.32776.stefan.seifert@atikon.com>

Recent Data::FormValidator needs a name for a constraint. Otherwise a code ref 
is returned from validation->invalid in list context for unnamed constraint 
methods leading to an error.

Also _add_new_user did not get any form data since Data::FormValidator was 
used directly by form_check instead of $c->form

Fixed by attached patch.

I would have mentioned this earlier if I'd realised there were [still]
active users out there.

I recently moved parley to github:

https://github.com/chiselwright/parley

I'm starting to look through the recent patches submitted to the list but
thought I should point you at a 'better' place to base patches from.

Obviously, if you're a github user too the fork/patch process is a lot
easier too.

One of my recent changes was to make my life easier, and I moved to
Dist::Zilla for testing and uploading to the CPAN:

https://github.com/chiselwright/parley/commit/d3e162c6d1a3ddef4f2be019eca7d376cef8be9f

Hopefully this doesn't make things too painful for other people looking at
the code for this project - I've found that the benefits far outweigh the
initial (and small) hurdle of installing Dist::Zilla locally as a developer.

Because of this move there's no inc/ or Module::Install to worry about any
more.

I'm looking at this patch now; the search_path change definitely makes
sense.

Was the removal of the change of owner for the parley schema/namespace
intentional?

i.e.

-ALTER SCHEMA parley OWNER TO parley;
+SET search_path = parley;


I've applied the patch as it stands and will worry about any consequences
later:

Intentional yes, but I forgot to mention them. When following the installation 
instructions, those owner changes are essentially redundant since objects 
created have the current user as owner anyway. And if someone wants to use a 
different user (probably his UNIX user) this redundandy makes installation 
just harder.

My goal is to integrate Parley with our Catalyst based CMS where every website 
has it's own PostgreSQL schema. I will try to keep differences to plain 
vanilla Parley as small as possible and maybe I'll come up with a way to just 
support both variants with the same code. We'll see.

Certainly great to see that this fine piece of software is still maintained :)

Subject: [Parley-discuss] dispatch type Chained
Message-ID: <201105181405.34324.stefan.seifert@atikon.com>

Hi,

I've created an experimental branch where I converted the Forum and Thread 
controllers' actions to Chained:
https://github.com/niner/parley/tree/chained

This not only makes nicer URIs, but removes the need for a auto action in the 
Root controller handling all kinds of parameters. This auto action currently 
is a major road block on my way to integrate Parley into our CMS, since I 
cannot have two Root controllers in one Catalyst app and I want to keep 
supporting code as little and as centralized as possible.

The Chained stuff works already. Only problem is that most URIs are written 
statically directly into the templates and do not come from uri_for. I guess I 
would have to change those to get this thing flying...

Are you interested in this development?

Definitely interested - I've always intended to clean-up the chaining and
I've also had in the back of my mind how bad/naughty I've been using static
URLs in the templates.
